#Simple MAKEFILE to build the Tetris Clone game.
#Can possibly work with both Linux and window with some minor changes.

#Windows cannot access the 'rm',the delete function in the target clean, outside of msys so you'll need gnu-make and msys installed.
#	Afterwards you can either run this makefile in the msys shell or if you have both msys and gnu-make in the windows path you can call
#	'make' at the cmdpromt in this directory to create the executable.
#	Make sure to adjust the SFMLINCLUDES and SFMLLIBPATH path to your own, you must have SFML installed to compile this.

#It code should work with linux with a bit of fixing. SFMLINCLUDES is pointing to a windows path, change it to the appropriate linux path of SFML's INCLUDE FILES.
#	The SFMLLIBPATH will also need to be redirected to the appropriate path.
